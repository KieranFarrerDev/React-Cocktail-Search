# React-Cocktail-Search
Fetching data from an API that returns instructions to make a cocktail that the user requests.

Further development goals:
- Return a list of ingredients
- Use another API to fetch average price of ingredients listed. Combine the total of ingredients to also display a price to make per cockatail, or an afordability score /10
